Quantum Edge Detection

This document proposes the final project for a quantum
computing course, providing a overview of the current state
and future potential of quantum edge detection. Additionally, it
explores quantum image encoding and conducts a pilot test based
on the ”Quantum Edge Detection” work available in the Qiskit
textbook [1]. The test employs a quantum algorithm for edge
detection (QHED) utilizing the Hadamard gate and an extra
qubit. The algorithm encodes pixel values into quantum state
amplitudes and applies the Hadamard gate to extract image
edges. The implementation is carried out on a quantum simulator
demonstrating the results obtain with quantum computing in
edge detection
